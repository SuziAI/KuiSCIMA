# KuiSCIMA
A digital machine-readable dataset of both purely symbolic and OMR-oriented representations of the music pieces in
Baishidaoren Gequ.

The dataset KuiSCIMA (Jiang Kui Score Images for Musicological Analysis) is the first machine-readable digital OMR
dataset containing ancient Chinese *suzipu* 俗字谱 notation. It is based on five different influential editions of
Jiang Kui's 17 *suzipu* pieces in the influential collection *Baishidaoren Gequ* 白石道人歌曲. The JSON format employed in
this dataset is semantically close to the original notation and features symbol-level annotations of the textual and
musical contents with their positions.
  
## Annotation Tool
The annotation tool used for viewing, editing and exporting from the KuiSCIMA dataset is available under
[https://github.com/SuziAI/gui-tools](https://github.com/SuziAI/gui-tools).
Currently, the version of `gui-tools` needed is tagged as `v2.0`.
